## Features

<CardHover />
<div class="card-cnt">
<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Collaborative Editing" icon="seti:db">
    Integrates with any editor supporting Y.js - ProseMirror, Quill, Monaco,
    BlockNote, Tiptap, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Storage Agnostic" icon="seti:db">
    Use any storage backend - Redis, PostgreSQL, S3, Cloudflare R2, or implement
    your own. Documents are never stored in-memory, making it perfect for
    scalable deployments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transport Flexible" icon="seti:html">
    Works with WebSockets, HTTP, Server-Sent Events, or any transport that
    supports bidirectional communication. Built on web-native Streams APIs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Runtime Agnostic" icon="node">
    Built on web primitives and works on any JavaScript runtime - Node.js, Bun,
    Deno, or any modern JavaScript environment. It's only plain JavaScript.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modular Architecture" icon="seti:folder">
    Teleportal is built as a composable set of modules that can be used together
    to make a complete sync server. Use your own auth, storage, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Encryption" icon="seti:lock">
    Supports end-to-end encryption and encryption at rest. Optional AES-GCM
    encryption for document updates and file transfers. Includes key management
    utilities and encrypted transport layers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitoring & Observability" icon="information">
    Built-in Prometheus metrics, health checks, and status endpoints. Track
    clients, sessions, messages, and performance metrics.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
